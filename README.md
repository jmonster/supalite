# Supalite

An editable baseline of the published `@supabase/lite` **0.11.0** package. Main retains the original package's functionality; feature changes remain on their respective branches until merged.

## Repeated filters

Repeated filters on one column are combined with AND. For example, `.neq('category', 'fruit').neq('category', 'vegetable')` excludes both categories. This also preserves repeated negated filters and existing logical groups on Node SQLite, libSQL, and PGlite; `npm test` includes regressions across all three adapters.

## Package

`upstream/lite-0.11.0/` contains the working JavaScript implementation, declarations, and package assets. The published JavaScript has been formatted for readability. The npm artifact does not include the original TypeScript sources.

The exact original package is preserved in Git commit `514fe6148b412ad4fdfe3eb2b3baed916e7e4911` and the [npm tarball](https://registry.npmjs.org/@supabase/lite/-/lite-0.11.0.tgz). `upstream/manifest.json` records that original artifact's provenance and checksums.

## Run

Requires Node.js 24 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
node upstream/lite-0.11.0/dist/cli/index.js --help
```

Tests import the tracked working package directly:

```js
import { App } from "../upstream/lite-0.11.0/dist/index.js";
```

`test/helpers/lite.mjs` supplies the shared SQLite, libSQL, and PGlite SDK harness. The pinned npm `@supabase/lite@0.11.0` dev dependency is available for explicit original-version comparisons.

Tests cover SDK insert, select, equality-filter, exact-count operations, export targets, and normal CLI behavior. They do not establish comprehensive compatibility.
